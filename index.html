          <h2 class="catamaran"> Our little love story </h2>
          <p>
            Our love story isn’t the typical high school sweetheart sort of thing. It’s way more real and--well--authentic? <br> Our story doesn’t actually begin that lovely African evening in 2010 when we met, because in all honesty, the way we met was pretty much the same as any other. One of us was seventeen and the other was twenty-one, both of us very oblivious to the amazing sequence of events that would only be revealed much later. </p>
        <p>
          Our little love story began two years and one month later when we chose each other. And it was only many years later that our little story tumbled into a travel scene one night in November 2014. We could never imagine our life being much different to that which we had already seen and known until that “aha” night. That night would turn out to be the moment that everything changed for us. <br> A normal evening transpired, somehow, into a conversation about our futures (it seems cliché, but it was very raw and real; nothing like those fairytale moments out of a Hollywood movie). Out of this conversation came a conclusion that a “travel life” was it for us, and within three months, we were engaged, had resigned and were on our way to northeast China. Yup, it was the travel life for us and learning how to become a “travel couple” wasn’t something we could Google. We just had to figure out the whole “travel-couple-life” thing on the road.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, we’ve most definitely figured out what it means to be a travel couple. On top of that, we’ve flown, sailed, dived, been scammed, chased by street dogs and had food poisoning (we call it wee-bums) more times than we can count. We’ve also hitched hiked, hiked, and been on safaris in both Sri Lanka and Africa. We’ve seen sunsets that still blow our minds just remembering them, we’ve traveled to some of the most epic temples in the world and we even got married while we were traveling. We could go on about how much travel we’ve done and all the countries we’ve been to since that “aha” moment, but most importantly, we’ve cried, laughed and loved together.
      </p>
      <p> Travel has taught us to love unique and real experiences, because it’s these travel moments that change us and deepen our souls. </p>
      <p> We love people and meeting new people- we love their stories and we’re sure we will love your story too; if there is anything in particular that we’ve learnt on the road that everyone has an amazing story. </p>
